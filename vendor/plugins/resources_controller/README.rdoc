== works with rails 2.0-stable, 2.1-stable, and edge

resources_controller works with rails 2.x and edge.

== Specs and Coverage

* The SPECDOC lists the specifications
* Coverage is 100% (C0), and the spec suite is quite comprehensive
* Rspec's generated rspec_scaffold controller specs are tested against a simple rc controller (see rake spec:generate)

RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> Do rake --tasks for more details.

== Continuous Integration
